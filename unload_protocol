Unloading Experiment Protocol

EMG
1. MVC RECORDING DON'T FORGET

Exoskeleton
1. Collect data separately for calibration procedure and kp adjustment. Call it calibration + number
2. Don't forget to open plotjuggler to assess kp adjustment
3. For compensation kp adjustment: turn on prediction mode and cheat mode
4. Change mass to mass of target object. Adjust kp until sensor value and compensation torque roughly match. 
5. Do not forget to change mass back to 0

Eye Tracking
1. Don't forget to start the object watching node. But start it as late as possible (aka right before trial begins)
2. Do not forget to adjust the front facing camera to match holding an object
